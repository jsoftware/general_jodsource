DESCRIPTION=: 0 : 0
(jodsource.zip) is an archive containing serialized dump
versions of the three JOD dictionary databases (joddev,jod,utils)
that are used to build the JOD system.  JOD system dictionaries are
good examples of how JOD can be used to build complex J systems.

In J 7.0x JOD requires the following addons:

  data/jfiles
  arc/zip 

JOD source dictionaries in (jodsource.zip) can be set up in two ways:

1) Run the J script ~addons/general/jodsource/jodsourcesetup.ijs

   This is the recommended method.  (jodsourcesetup.ijs) has been
   checked on Windows j6.02, j7.01 and linux j7.01  32 bit systems.
   NOTE: It can take a minute or so to run.

2) Run the JOD lab "JOD Source Code Dump Scripts." 
   JOD labs are in the general lab category.

   JOD labs have not been made completely portable between
   Windows and Linux.  This lab works on Windows and it
   will work on Linux as well: provided you do not have
   any extant JOD dictionaries.
